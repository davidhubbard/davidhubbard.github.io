# What's in a license?

*The FSF rallies people to their freedom to share software. But I think
there are deeper roots of freedom, culture and how to share &mdash; that
striving to live by traditional morals could satisfy the FSF and have
other benefits too.*

## What's in a license?

Specifically, what does the
[GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html)
mean?

Please follow the link to find out what the license is (its definition, it's about
copying software, and so forth).

When Free Software began to get noticed, used and become popular, apparently the
first step was to clone the idea and modify it. Let's say it was "forked." The
derivative idea was called Open Source Software.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software#Definitions):

> Despite initially accepting it,[[13]](https://web.archive.org/web/20060924132022/http://www.opensource.org/docs/history.php)
> Richard Stallman of the FSF now flatly opposes the term "Open Source" being applied
> to what they refer to as "free software". Although he agrees that the two terms
> describe "almost the same category of software", Stallman considers equating the
> terms incorrect and misleading.[[14]](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html)
> Stallman also opposes the professed pragmatism of the Open Source Initiative, as
> he fears that the free software ideals of freedom and community are threatened by
> compromising on the FSF's idealistic standards for software
> freedom.[[15]](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html)
> The FSF considers free software to be a subset of open-source software, and
> Richard Stallman explained that DRM software, for example, can be developed as
> open source, despite that it does not give its users freedom (it restricts them),
> and thus does not qualify as free
> software.[14]

I think it's worth giving equal screen time to the FSF to state their position:

<https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html>

> The terms “free software” and “open source” stand for almost the same range of
> programs. However, they say deeply different things about those programs, based
> on different values. The free software movement campaigns for freedom for the
> users of computing; it is a movement for freedom and justice. By contrast, the
> open source idea values mainly practical advantage and does not campaign for
> principles. This is why we do not agree with open source, and do not use that
> term.

That final sentence sums up a very nice point of philosophy: terminology matters.
If the FSF doesn't use a term, they do so for a well thought out reason, and I
admire that.

How much impact has Free Software *and derivative licenses* affected our lives?
Take the following with a grain of salt, since it appears to miss the distinction
between the FSF and derivative licenses.

Skip the debate over the actual numbers. Free Software can be estimated to
offer a 3.5x reduction in effort and produced ~$9 trillion USD in value in
2024.

There are nonfungible costs though. I mean, choosing to go with Free Software
comes with responsibilities:

* At the point of distribution, limited access to the source is a requirement
* Due diligence is required about the license's legal status
* What about the financial impact of the social contract?

That last one is interesting because the social contract has different meanings
to different groups of people in 2024. To some, a company that does open source
(if at all) is their preference. To others, the company becomes a target of
intense criticism because it is perceived as "open for feedback," regardless of
whether the company actually asked for outside contributors.

But then again, in 2024, intense scrutiny of companies is something of a popular
pastime, regardless of their software license policy. Perhaps Free Software
signals the company's stance is more avant garde, attracting attention?

And choosing to show the source at all makes it easier for patent litigation
to proceed against the company.

## Moral or rational decisions

The reality is that companies can't exist for long if their gross income is
negative. Also not every good idea comes out on top. Software is in a unique
position though: the source code is both the blueprint and the
building. Or to use a car analogy, software is both the map and the gas
to get there. I can't think of much else that simultaneously is worth
trillions in actual currency for the first copy, and costs less than a
penny to make each incremental copy. Thus I conclude that software can
sometimes escape destruction even if it's distributed for zero money -
if it is perceived as valuable.

In other words, software thrives not on harsh reality alone, but on what
people value. And people's values reflect their morals.

There's an entire tangent at this point about a paradox in business decision
making: is a business moral, consensus-driven ethical, or coldly profit
driven?

For brevity, I'll assert an axiom. (It means, assume we agreed or at least
stopped arguing, so I can stay on topic.)

Axiom: assume the most successful businesses achieve an intense balance of
morals and pragmatic self-interest. Their customers are treated well even
when it takes extra time or costs extra - and the company survives by
optimizing their products and processes to maximize profit and minimze loss.

Is the FSF the moral choice?

## The FSF's values

From the FSF's [post](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html)
above:

> These freedoms are vitally important. They are essential, not just for the
> individual users' sake, but for society as a whole because they promote
> social solidarity—that is, sharing and cooperation. They become even more
> important as our culture and life activities are increasingly digitized.
> In a world of digital sounds, images, and words, free software becomes
> increasingly essential for freedom in general.

I admire the FSF's values but by attempting to explore them below, I may miss
something, especially since my values differ from the FSF's. I'm going to
claim the FSF's values are something like &mdash;

1. Freedom - probably in the sense of the
   [EU Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights):
   > All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
   > They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one
   > another in a spirit of brotherhood.

   In practical terms, I analyze the FSF's ideal for any company producing
   Free Software. I think it would be a company that attempts to:
   * make their software less restrictive
   * make their software more empowering of creative and unexpected uses
   * make their software more compatible with unexpected systems and other
     software (that probably is not Free Software)
   * make their software more well-built and secure to prevent bugs or
     security failures for the user
   * avoid legal action that harms users if the software is used in ways
     that "don't harm anyone else" (see EU Declaration of Human Rights,
     Article 12)

   ...and so forth.

2. Culture - probably in the sense of arts, intellectual achievements,
   meaningful scientific work, meaningful business work, and popular expressions
   of the above.

3. Sharing - There's a tangent about copyright law, restrictive software,
   and copying bits, which is avoided here. My analysis of the FSF's values
   for sharing are that it is in the sense of the EU Declaration of Human
   Rights, Article 19. I'll bold-face the part I think is relevant:

   > Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this
   > right includes freedom to hold opinions **without interference** and to
   > **seek, receive and impart information** and ideas through any media
   > and regardless of frontiers.

Ok, time to take those tangents about copyright law, restrictive software,
and moral-vs-consensus-ethical-vs-coldly-profit motives. Terminology matters.
I admire the FSF's well-thought-out and succinct explanation
[here](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Piracy):

> **"Piracy"**
> 
> Publishers often refer to copying they don't approve of as "piracy." In
> this way, they imply that it is ethically equivalent to attacking ships on
> the high seas, kidnapping and murdering the people on them. Based on such
> propaganda, they have procured laws in most of the world to forbid copying
> in most (or sometimes all) circumstances. (They are still pressuring to make
> these prohibitions more complete.)
> 
> If you don't believe that copying not approved by the publisher is just like
> kidnapping and murder, you might prefer not to use the word "piracy" to
> describe it. Neutral terms such as "unauthorized copying" (or "prohibited
> copying" for the situation where it is illegal) are available for use
> instead. Some of us might even prefer to use a positive term such as
> "sharing information with your neighbor."
> 
> A US judge, presiding over a trial for copyright infringement, recognized
> that ["piracy" and "theft" are smear words](https://web.archive.org/web/20240207040538/https://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-banned-from-using-piracy-and-theft-terms-in-hotfile-trial-131129/).

The FSF's values are for companies to be able to make money for software.
However, the FSF doesn't compromise on their values if money is at stake.
Instead, they are consistent in pointing out how we all benefit, objectively,
by adhering to these values.

Companies that did embrace Free Software outperformed their competitors.
Their competitors actively opposing Free Software found it impractical
to ignore the economic benefits of these values. Now most companies
are heavily reliant on Free Software.

Recap:

1. Software can become valuable by being widely perceived as valuable,
   even as it is shared for zero cost.
2. Companies that stick to morals can outperform their competitors,
   especially by sharing software.
3. The FSF's values are a real-world case study of (1) and (2).
4. Many do not agree with the FSF, possibly because they fear losing
   control of secrets they think are valuable. (But doesn't this
   support (1)?)

The FSF rallies people to their freedom to share software. But I think
there are deeper roots of freedom, culture and how to share &mdash; that
striving to live by traditional morals could satisfy the FSF and have
other benefits too.

By striving to live higher morals, not the more pragmatic Open Source
licenses, people and companies would benefit from everything the FSF
offers. By adding deeper roots to the FSF's values, some debates
might fade away.

## What then do you propose?

Of course I'm writing about all of this because I have my own opinion.
(Safe to assume any author has a bias.)

In the next post, I'll introduce a software license based on traditional
morals.
