# Calling all Engineers

Calling all engineers: do you want to join the highest cause?

Here is Jesus Christ's call:

“By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.” (John 13:34)

Don't be afraid of rejection. Don't be afraid of your own weaknesses.

"And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made
perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my
infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me." (2 Corinthians 12:9)

Rise up, women and men of God!

### To do ... what?

We are building Zion. If you feel like contributing in any way, head over to
[the discussion](https://github.com/davidhubbard/davidhubbard.github.io/discussions)

### FAQ: Shouldn't I wait until my priest agrees with you?

**Definitely, counsel with your leader.** This is a charitable contribution,
and we would expect no less than your scrutiny before you jump in.

As Jesus said, "Come and see." (John 1:38-39)

This is exciting work. We are building in full knowledge that half of what we
build (or more) will be rebuilt later.

### FAQ: I definitely don't agree with what you're doing. What should I do?

Please be respectful of the community we are building. We're doing it as an
expression of love.

### FAQ: What about another project?

We pick the projects that are the best fit for our team. Please feel
liberated to work on the project that you're most passionate about!
