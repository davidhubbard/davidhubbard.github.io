# Paradoxes in Quantum Physics

In no particular order -

## Particles are Waves

Particles and waves are the same. Particles and waves are a duality.

Particles can be represented as a sum of waves in momentum space.

Particles can be represented as a sum of waves in position space.

## Position and Velocity are linked

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle makes it impossible to know some matter's
position and velocity together, beyond a certain limit.

## Mass is Energy

Special Relativity shows that momentum treats mass and energy the same:
mass and energy are equivalent. Mass and energy are a duality.

## Gravity is Curved Spacetime is Momentum

Gravity and the curvature of spacetime are the same. The force of gravity is
the same as momentum.

## Time is Velocity

General Relativity shows that as matter's velocity increases, time is dilated.

## What Emerges

The results can be weird:

* Photons do not experience time. They carry information through space at the
  speed of light until they are either scattered, reflected or absorbed by
  matter. Matter always experiences time, and cannot quite reach the speed of
  light.

* Matter at speeds approaching the speed of light has more mass (energy), and
  its position cannot be known accurately until it collides and releases most
  of its momentum into the surrounding matter - and some energy may escape as
  photons.

* One photon can take multiple paths to its destination, like a ripple can
  swirl around obstacles before it reaches you, without losing momentum.

* 99% of the mass in any proton is the strong force energy keeping the quarks
  from flying apart. Only 1% is from Higgs interactions giving rest mass to the
  quarks. In the periodic table the mass of an isotope is not the count of the
  protons and neutrons; this is because the binding energy varies and can even
  be manipulated by doing fission or fusion.

* Velocity relative to something is easy. Absolute velocity may not even exist -
  the closest measurement we know of is (with some uncertainty) the cosmic microwave
  background is redshifted in one direction and blueshifted in the other.

* Gravity affects other objects almost as if it were felt instantly. The tiny
  difference felt when an object is accelerating is what causes gravitational waves.

* Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light.
