# Jesus' Approach to Software

Did Jesus manage any software projects? I'll be upfront and say, definitively,
no.

The rest of this post attempts to imagine if He did. It's a major challenge to
imagine, "what would Jesus do?" with proper reverence for God. You probably
have some feedback. I probably won't be ready to receive it yet, but here's me
acknowledging this is a rough idea, an epiphany.

## Why not just use a miracle?

It seems an old new idea in software is this: make a rough prototype and use
that as long as possible. Call it "user studies," "requirements gathering," or
the 80-20 rule taken to its extreme. It seems software that barely works
has the most potential to succeed - "early access," alpha and beta quality
software, find the minimum viable product.

I've heard it said often: "It's a miracle that worked."

Software that only does the minimum needed to be useful leaves a lot of gaps
which encourage brainstorming, discussions, and careful thought.

Miracles that only do the minimum to restore "what God wills" have often
left gaps in my understanding. Jesus' miracles have taught me a lot by what's
left unsaid.

## The 10 Commandments

I think the 10 Commandments are software-like. Instead of an obtuse
legalistic license with thousands of pages, they are brief. They assume I
already have a clear understanding of who God is (Theology) and my
relationship to Him. The rest of the Old Testament could be the assets for
the 10 Commandments, the way software has assets next to the code.

The 10 Commandments define limits, something software often does. Looking at
how successful civilizations have adhered to the 10 commandments, I assume the
large number of copies of The Code means something.

Even more interesting is that God provided The Code by a miracle, writing it in
stone and creating fire in various improbable places (a bush, a mountain).
My point is it's a miracle the 10 Commandments work so well.

See Exodus chapter 20.

## Can I make better software by studying Jesus?

I hope so! Let me quickly dismiss any claim that what I'm doing is "Jesus
approved." Matthew 18 verses 19-20 only say that Jesus might come and
participate.

I think that means Jesus would have liked cooperative, collaborative software.
Perhaps the user freedoms from a Free Software license align with Matthew
chapter 5 verses 7 and 9, or chapter 7 verse 12.

On one point, Jesus was abundantly clear: give glory to God. (Matthew
chapter 5 verse 16) Here's my practical application of this:

1. Assign copyright to an organization, instead of retaining copyright as
   an individual
2. Use a license that specifically names Jesus Christ, though the license
   may be liberal to all who accept Jesus Christ
3. Exercise restraint and humility, not claiming mortal works are
   divine or perfect

The [Christian Disciple Prayer and License](https://github.com/davidhubbard/christiandiscipleprayerandlicense)
is an incomplete text that can be filled out to meet these goals.

## Postscript: Acts 2

Acts 2:44-46 and 4:32-35 say:

2:44 "And all that believed were together, and had all things common;"
2:45 "And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men,
as every man had need."
2:46 "And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and
breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and
singleness of heart,"

4:32 "And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one
soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed
was his own; but they had all things common."
4:33 "And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of
the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all."
4:34 "Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were
possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things
that were sold,"
4:35 "And laid them down at the apostlesâ€™ feet: and distribution was made unto
every man according as he had need."

To understand what that means, I've boiled down the following economic
systems for comparison:

1. Feudalism: the economic system practiced in Europe 1000-1800
2. Communism in the form of the Communist Manifesto
3. Communalism: communism within a Christian context
4. Socialism: communism in a large nation-state
5. Capitalism in the form in the United States in the 1790s
6. Liberal Capitalism as practiced in the European Union in 2025
7. Acts 2

The analysis started as a table but quickly grew unwieldy in that form. I'll
look at the following axes:

A. The supreme authority written into the laws.

B. What property ownership looks like.

C. What sets prices and production quotas.

D. What rememdies are offered for poverty.

### Feudalism

A. Supreme Authority: "divine right of kings" grants this to the king

B. Property Ownership: the king deeds feifs to his court of lords

C. Price and Production: the king collects taxes, tariffs, and may ban
products or trade. The fiat government may be successful but
eventually devolves into an authoritarian nightmare in direct
opposition to the majority of the population.

D. Poverty: voluntary aid or else none at all

### Communist Manifesto

A. Supreme Authority: worker unions

B. Property Ownership: ideally none at all, though a few or many in
the population will try to refuse, hence the need for socialism

C. Price and Production: voluntary or none at all

D. Poverty: ideally all households receive exactly the same allotment,
but this requires heavy policing to enforce, hence the need for socialism

### Communalism

A. Supreme Authority: worker unions speak for God

B. Property Ownership: ideally none at all, leading to socialism

C. Price and Production: voluntary or none at all

D. Poverty: ideally all households receive exactly the same allotment,
but as this inevitably is tested a need to cede authority to a central
govenrment leads to socialism

### Socialism

A. Supreme Authority: worker unions cede control to a central committee, which
selects a supreme leader. All religions except Atheism are outlawed

B. Property Ownership: property leases granted from central government, which
China has called a free market by using arrests and economic controls instead
of calling it a lease

C. Price and Production: commanded from central government

D. Poverty: ideally all households receive exactly the same allotment,
but the bureaucracy effectively has priority and the power to punish any
possible claims of unequal treatment, devolving into a fiat government
indistinguishable from feudalism

### Capitalism

A. Supreme Authority: the people, self-governing and temperate before God

B. Property Ownership: individual property deeds, originating with the
"colonization" of land that usually means the displacement of
indigenous peoples

C. Price and Production: voluntary following supply and demand. This can lead
to excessive wealth held by a few super wealthy individuals, which can cause
the general population to question capitalism or even vote to abolish it

D. Poverty: voluntary aid or else none at all

### Liberal Capitalism

A. Supreme Authority: the law, which does not acknowledge any God

B. Property Ownership: individual property, heavily taxed to support
government programs

C. Price and Production: voluntary following supply and demand, with
government asset seizures, "haircuts," inflation and taxes. This is generally
accepted as a necessary evil in order to fund popular causes

D. Poverty: if the poor class is popular, they receive government-backed care;
otherwise they have none at all

### Acts 2

Before analyizing the verses in Acts, it's worth noting the motivation for a
different economic system. All of the above systems create feelings of
jealousy and resentment. All of the above systems rely on some form of
coercive force, taking property and then attempting to accumulate as much
as possible.

In Acts 2, the people's faith in God changed them, to the point they were
willing to treat one another with dignity. No economic system can change
people's hearts this way.

A. Supreme Authority: sustain the existing laws of each country, wherever
located; the union of their hearts into one heart motivates generosity
*and kindness*.

B. Property Ownership: whatever system of property ownership is already
practiced in each country; their willingness facilitates their making
sacred gifts to one another

C. Price and Production: the same as their existing country's economics

D. Poverty: both physical *and spiritual* poverty are addressed

### Post-Postscript

Maybe Jesus' approach to software uses a different calculus than binary
and a different computer than digital logic. His approach has some useful
wisdom for software:

* Keep in mind the human interface and user experience
* Be kind and patient with others, without compromising on personal beliefs
* A software license that preserves downstream rights is valuable; a software
  license that adds to that Christian values might be even more so.
