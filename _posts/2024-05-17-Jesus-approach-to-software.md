# Jesus' Approach to Software

Did Jesus manage any software projects? I'll be upfront and say, definitively,
no.

The rest of this post attempts to imagine if He did. It's a major challenge to
imagine, "what would Jesus do?" with proper reverence for God. You probably
have some feedback. I probably won't be ready to receive it yet, but here's me
acknowledging this is a rough idea, an epiphany.

## Why not just use a miracle?

It seems an old new idea in software is this: make a rough prototype and use
that as long as possible. Call it "user studies," "requirements gathering," or
the 80-20 rule taken to its extreme. It seems software that barely works
has the most potential to succeed - "early access," alpha and beta quality
software, find the minimum viable product.

I've heard it said often: "It's a miracle that worked."

Software that only does the minimum needed to be useful leaves a lot of gaps
which encourage brainstorming, discussions, and careful thought.

Miracles that only do the minimum to restore "what God wills" have often
left gaps in my understanding. Jesus' miracles have taught me a lot by what's
left unsaid.

## The 10 Commandments

I think the 10 Commandments are almost software. Instead of an obtuse
legalistic license with thousands of pages, they are brief. They assume I
already have a clear understanding of who God is (Theology) and my
relationship to Him. The rest of the Old Testament is not the 10 Commandments
same as how assets are not code.

The 10 Commandments define limits, something software often does. Looking at
how successful civilizations have adhered to the 10 commandments, I assume the
large number of copies of The Code means something.

## Can I make better software by studying Jesus?

I hope so!

Other than shipping a minimum viable product, I'm not sure I can claim what I
do is "Jesus approved."

I'll post more ideas as they come to me. I think Jesus would approve of the
free expression of thought, as a means to come to know Him better.
